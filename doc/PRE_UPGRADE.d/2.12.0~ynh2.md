### Application is fixed

Since the inception of this app, the upstream code was actually a fork created to make it compatible with YunoHost database.
It has basically been abandoned for a long time now, and the upstream Owntracks app has changed a lot.
This upgrade will install both the recorder that stores the location data and the frontend that displays it.

### Data migration is not handled

The new app does not use a database anymore, but a set of files holding all the data.
If the app was somehow working for you so far, your data will NOT be migrated.
Export the automated backup made before the update, or make a dedicated one.
