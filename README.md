## Disclaimers / important information

## Features

- [OwnTracks features for a HTTP API](http://owntracks.org/booklet/tech/http/), limited to the [features implemented by the PHP recorder](https://github.com/tomyvi/php-owntracks-recorder#features). Notably, no Friends feature. The [upstream PHP recorder has been tweaked](https://github.com/tituspijean/php-owntracks-recorder) to remove a cumbersome PHP dependency.
- Multi-user: each YunoHost user can connect though basic HTTP authentication, and has only access to their data.
